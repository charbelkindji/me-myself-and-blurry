A flask project for face detection and blurring (based on the [MTCNN](https://github.com/ipazc/mtcnn) library).

## Demo

The project is currently being deployed on the Heroku platform (work in progress). It's happening [here](https://me-myself-and-blurry.herokuapp.com).

## Run locally

To run the project, clone this repository and run the app.py file.
